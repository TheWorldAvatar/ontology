# The World Avatar Ontology library

This repository contains ontological concepts for TWA projects

## Contribution

Changes made to an ontology on the default branch (`main`) must be made via a Pull Request. Contributors must ensure that version numbers are incremented within the relevant OWL file i.e.

```xml
<?xml version="x.y"?>
```

This must be verified by the reviewer of the Pull Request. This is not enforced for individual ontologies via any action but is present as a manual check in the PR template.
