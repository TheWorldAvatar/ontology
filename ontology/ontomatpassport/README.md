## Ontology for Material Passport (OntoMatPassport) ##
OntoMatPassport is a generic ontology that represents the common properties of the material passport of a product or component across applications in the automotive, wind turbine blade, and electronic industries. It is also known as an ontology for materials and products life-cycle (OntoMPLC) representation. The life cycle is managed via the temporal aspect of the material passport of a product or component.

## Material Passport Ontology (MPO)
The new version of OntoMatPassport is called the Material Passport Ontology (MPO), which is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWorldAvatar/ontology/refs/heads/dev-composite-materials-ontology/ontology/ontomatpassport/MPO.owl).

### Documentation
The HTML documentation (LODE) is available [here](./doc/extract.htm)

## Application ##
OntoMatPassport or MPO can be used to represent material passports of products or components and enable data interoperability across industiral stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, collectors, and recyclers, to calculate the material circularity indicator of a product or component that requires data from multiple parties. OntoAutoMatPassport, OntoWTBladePassport, and OntoPCBMatPassport are application ontologies created by extending OntoMatPassport (OntoMPLC) to support the representation of automotive, wind turbine blade, and printed circuit board applications-specific data, respectively.
